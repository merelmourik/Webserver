# Webserv
Created a webserver which is able to handle http requests. Written in C++ from scratch and yes we stole some ideas from nginx.

## How it works
Because watching video's is always more clear then reading my writing:

If you run the two scripts the webserv will be compiled and the test program will be set as well. After that the tester will be busy for 10 minutes more or less testing every possible flaw in the server. You will notice when the tester is done :)
